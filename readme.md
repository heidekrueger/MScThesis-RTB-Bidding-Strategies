This repository contains (parts) of the work related to my MSc thesis.

In my thesis I analytically and empirically compared various bidding strategies in Computational Real Time Bidding (from a DSP's point of view) with respect to their economic, game theoretical and computational properties.

The code in this repository is not operational as some of it is context-specific and the input data (based on iPinYou dataset) is missing, as you need to sign a licensing agreement when obtaining the original data.
This repository serves primarily as a backup for myself.
